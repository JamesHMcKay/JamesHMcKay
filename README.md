### Hi, I'm James.

I develop software to solve problems with data. I have PhD in dark matter physics and enjoy taking on new challenges.

I'm currently working at Statistics New Zealand on a data processing system, and am available for work as a freelancer on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/).

Connect with me on LinkedIn.
